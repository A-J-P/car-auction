#MATH710 Class project - Bentley University/Business Analytics Program


Intro:  
  Car purchase is always a headache issue for car buyers, especially for people who plan to buy used car.
Second-hand car buyers would try to research the cars information before purchase to avoid buying
bad cars. The same situation happens to auto dealers.Car dealers buy used cars through auctions or
trade-ins. One of the biggest challenges of an auto dealership purchasing a used car at an auto auction
is the risk of that the vehicle might have serious issues that prevent it from being sold to customers.
The auto community calls these unfortunate purchases "kicks". Kicked cars often result when there
are tampered odometers, mechanical issues the dealer is not able to address, issues with getting the
vehicle title from the seller, or some other unforeseen problems. Kick cars can be very costly to dealers
after transportation cost, throwaway repair work, and market losses in reselling the vehicle.

Puropose:  
  The purpose of this project is to identify if a car bought a acution is lemon. The object of this report is
to anayze the data provided by Carvana to predict if the used car purchased at the Auction is a Kick (bad buy),
which can be used in the future purchase to lower the risk of buying cars from auctions. To be specic, we want 
to gure out what kinds of used cars tend to be a bad buy for the dealers. Beside those questions, we try to fgure 
out some specic questions that can help the dealers with car purchase. To answer those questions, we will perform 
three analysis, including the data visualization, decision tree and logistic regression, regarding the variables 
within the dataset in the next step.
